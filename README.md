# ADSO (Arduino Digital Storage Oscilloscope)

## What is ADSO?
ADSO is a digital storage oscilloscope running on an arduino microcontroller. It samples, stores and analyses an electrical signal.
## How do I run ARC?
Buy an arduino, install the arduino software (including appropriate libraries) on your PC and compile/upload "calc.ino" to your arduino. By defining (and compiling) one input and one output channel ARC can be operated by a serial keyboard (terminal software like screen or putty) or a 12 key keyboard (4 rows, 3 columns). Output will be shown on a terminal or a 128x64 OLED-display.
